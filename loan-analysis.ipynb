    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "LendingClub Corporation operates as an online marketplace that connects borrowers and investors in the United States. Its marketplace facilitates various types of loan products for consumers and small businesses, including unsecured personal loans, super prime consumer loans, unsecured education and patient finance loans, and unsecured small business loans. The company also offers investors an opportunity to invest in a range of loans based on term and credit characteristics. However, many loans issued through Lending Club end up being defaulted on by the borrower. The goal of this notebook is to examine the historical loan data available in order to generate a model to predict the return on investment that a new loan will generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Provided\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club provides CSV files of historical data for its loans. These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period stated, including the loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The files can be acquired on the [Lending Club Statistics Page](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). As of the creation of this project the latest data available from Lending Club was for Q1 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on the definitions of fields contained within the historical data please see the [Lending Club Data Dictionary](https://github.com/Booleans/consumer-loan-survival-analysis/blob/master/data/LCDataDictionary.xlsx?raw=true).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoanStats3a file also contains information on loan applications that were declined and never issued. I have discarded those rows of data as they are not relevant to predicting loan defaults. I have also removed the last 2 rows of every spreadsheet, as they contained aggregate information on the number of loans in the file."

    "Certain columns may be immediately ignored and not loaded into the dataframe. Some columns provide information that was not available upon loan origination (e.g. interest received from loan payments, late fees collected). Other columns are dropped for containing information that is not relevant to whether a loan will default or not (e.g. borrower id number, url that the loan is listed at). Joint loan applications are relatively new at Lending Club therefore all columns related to joint applications and secondary applicants will be ignored.\n",

For example, borrowers used to be able to write text to give their loans a title and description. Borrowers are no longer allowed to do so. The zip code field used to be provided but now it has been obscured by Lending Club so that investors do not discriminate against borrowers in poor or minority neighborhoods. Certain fields, such as information that only applies to loans being made by two applicants together, are rarely used. A heatmap will give a visual representation of missing data, where missing data is green.  "
